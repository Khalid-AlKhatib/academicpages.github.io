Khalid Al-Khatib is a postdoc in the Text Mining and Retrieval Group at Leipzig University. His main research interests are argumentation mining, argumentation knowledge-graphs, and argument generation. In his PhD thesis about argumentation strategies, Khalid investigates questions such as: How do people argue on the Web? What are the strategies that people use to persuade others? Which strategies are the most successful ones in particular contexts? Khalid published more than 20 argumentation-related papers on top-tier venues including AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, and also serves on the respective program committees. He has been contributing to the development of the argument search engine 'args.me'. His current research is on the exploitation of argumentation graphs for argument generation. Khalid is one of the recipients of the IBM PhD Fellowship Award (2017).
